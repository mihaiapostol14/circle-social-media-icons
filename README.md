## About
This project provides a set of circular social media icons (SVG or font-based) with hover/focus states and optional JavaScript interactivity (tooltips/keyboard support). It is intended for small projects, landing pages, and developer portfolios where a minimal, accessible icon set is preferred.

## Technologies Used
This project keeps dependencies minimal and uses the following core web technologies:

- HTML
  - Semantic markup: each icon is an anchor (<a>) inside a list for grouping and keyboard focus behavior.
  - Accessible attributes (aria-labels and visually-hidden text) to ensure screen-reader friendliness.

- CSS
  - Modern layout (Flexbox) to align icons and support responsive wrapping.
  - CSS variables for easy theming and size adjustments.
  - Border-radius and background styling for perfect circular shapes.
  - Transitions and transforms for smooth hover and focus animations.
  - Mobile-friendly and high-DPI (retina) aware styles.
  - Minimal reset/utility rules to make integration into existing projects simple.

- JavaScript (optional)
  - Small progressive enhancement script to:
    - Add keyboard shortcuts or focus outlines if needed.
    - Show accessible tooltips on hover/focus.
    - Provide small runtime features (for example: toggling color themes or copying profile links).
  - The project works without JavaScript; scripts only improve usability.

## Features
- Circular icon appearance with hover and focus effects
- Easy to style using CSS variables
- Accessible markup and keyboard-friendly
- Lightweight — minimal JS and no dependencies
- Ready to drop into static sites or frameworks (React/Vue/Angular) with the same markup/CSS
